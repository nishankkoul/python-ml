What is Anaconda used for in data science?

In data science, Anaconda is mainly used as a distribution that simplifies installing, managing, and working with Python (and R) for data analysis, machine learning, and scientific computing.

Here’s what it’s good for:

a. Package Management

-> Comes with conda, a powerful package manager that handles installing and updating libraries (like NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn) without dependency headaches.
-> Works better than pip for some scientific packages that require compiled binaries (like NumPy with optimized BLAS).

b. Environment Management

-> Lets you create isolated environments with specific versions of Python and libraries, avoiding conflicts between projects.
-> For example, you can have one project on Python 3.8 with TensorFlow 2.4 and another on Python 3.11 with PyTorch without breaking either.

c. Preinstalled Data Science Stack

-> Ships with 1,500+ popular data science and machine learning libraries already included (pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy, Jupyter Notebook, etc.).
-> Saves time compared to installing everything manually.

d. Jupyter & Development Tools

-> Integrates with Jupyter Notebook/Lab, Spyder, and VS Code.
-> Makes interactive data analysis easy with built-in visualization and exploration tools.

In short: Anaconda is like a Swiss Army knife for data scientists — it packages Python, R, and all the tools you need in a way that’s easy to install, manage, and replicate.



For any projects you work on its always a best practice to launch a separate environment for it. 
To create a virtual environment, execute this command at the root level: conda create -p venv python==3.10

This will create a venv folder at the root level and we'll be executing our projects inside this virtual environment itself.

To switch to venv, execute the command: conda activate venv

Now whatever commands we run on the terminal, those will be executed inside this environment.

We'll be making an extensive use of scikit-learn library throughout this course, so we'll create a requirements.txt at the root directory and then do: pip install -r requirements.txt

This will install the scikit-learn library inside the virtual environment.

To run jupyter Notebooks in ipynb format, first install this package using the command: pip install ipykernel
